# Random Quote Generator

* This generator has been written *without* jQuery.
* Added a tags property to categorise quotes.
* When the quote changes, the background colour of the page randomly changes.
* A quote is only displayed once, until all of the quotes in the array have been displayed. Check the console to see the logs for this by clicking 'Show another quote'.
* The quote auto refreshes every 30 seconds, showing a new quote.
