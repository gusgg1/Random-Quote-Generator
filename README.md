# Random Quote Generator

#### Project 1

###### This is my first of twelve projects for the Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

* This quote-generator has been written in pure Vanilla JavaScript, without the help of jQuery, plugins or any framework.
* Added a tags property to categorise quotes.
* When the quote changes, the background color of the page randomly changes.
* A quote is only displayed once, until all of the quotes in the array have been displayed. Check the console to see the logs for this by clicking 'Show another quote'.
* The quote auto refreshes every 30 seconds, showing a new quote.
* If clicked on the button the auto refresh timer will be reset back to 30 seconds, making sure that the timer is always 30 seconds at any moment.
